# ACM certificate configuration for HTTPS support on CloudFront

# This resource requests a wildcard SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
# The certificate will be valid for both the main domain (ibrahimkilicaslan.click) and all subdomains (*.ibrahimkilicaslan.click).
# Note: For CloudFront, the certificate MUST be created in the us-east-1 region, regardless of where your other resources are.

}

# This resource validates the ACM certificate by creating the required DNS records in Route53.
# Terraform will automatically create the necessary CNAME records for validation.
# Once validated, the certificate can be used by CloudFront for HTTPS on all your domains and subdomains.
